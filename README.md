# UE5-ChunkSphere
In this project I will expand on icosphere by dividing the sphere into "chunks" that can be individually subdivided for added performance.


made a decision to just search all the chunks for close subdivisions (roughly caps divisions at like 4 but only need < 5 then subdivide chunks)
